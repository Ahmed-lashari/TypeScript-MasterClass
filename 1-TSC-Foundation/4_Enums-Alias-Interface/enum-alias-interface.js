// ENUMS
// Theory and Usage
// An enum (enumeration) is a way to define a set of named constant values
// that donâ€™t change.
// For Example:
// Days of the Week
// Months in a Year
// Months in a Year
// Roles in some Organization/Institute
// SYNTAX
// enum variableName {enum1, enum2, enum3...}
var WeekDays;
(function (WeekDays) {
    WeekDays[WeekDays["Sunday"] = 0] = "Sunday";
    WeekDays[WeekDays["Monday"] = 1] = "Monday";
    WeekDays[WeekDays["Tuesday"] = 2] = "Tuesday";
    WeekDays[WeekDays["Wednesday"] = 3] = "Wednesday";
    WeekDays[WeekDays["Thursday"] = 4] = "Thursday";
    WeekDays[WeekDays["Friday"] = 5] = "Friday";
    WeekDays[WeekDays["Saturday"] = 6] = "Saturday";
})(WeekDays || (WeekDays = {}));
// Instead of making a list, tupple, or seperate variables for each day, we created an enum and now each value of it can be accessed individually, unlike lists or tupples index based approach; e-g
console.log(WeekDays.Sunday); // will give the index : 0
// we can assign/initilize each value in an enum like this;
// These will give an error becaus the enum is already initilized and now cannot be changed
// WeekDays.Sunday = "Sunday";
// WeekDays.Monday = "Monday";
// WeekDays.Tuesday = "Tuesday";
// WeekDays.Wednesday = "Wednesday";
// WeekDays.Thursday = "Thursday";
// WeekDays.Friday = "Friday";
// WeekDays.Saturday = "Saturday";

// INTERFACES
// INTErfaces are aslo the similar thing like ALIAS but they are only used with objects
// Normal Approach while making OBJECTS
