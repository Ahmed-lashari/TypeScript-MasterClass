# 🚀 TypeScript Backend Learning Journey

On my journey to becoming a **Full Stack Flutter Developer**, I knew that mastering the **backend** side was just as important as building clean, powerful UIs. To lay a solid foundation, I began by learning **JavaScript**, diving deep into its fundamentals and how it powers modern web servers using **Node.js**.

### 📘 My Learning Progress So Far

1. ✅ **JavaScript Fundamentals** – from variables and functions to objects, arrays, and async programming.
2. ✅ **Node.js Project** – explored building a simple backend with Node.js to understand request handling, modules, and basic routing.

### 🚧 Next Step: TypeScript for Backend Development

In this repository, I will be documenting my learning and hands-on projects with **TypeScript**, focused entirely on backend-specific concepts. TypeScript adds **type safety, clarity, and scalability** — all crucial for writing reliable backend logic and APIs.

---

### 🧠 Topics I Will Be Covering (Backend-Specific TypeScript)

- ✅ **Setting Up a TypeScript Project**
- ✅ **Compiling TypeScript to JavaScript**
- ✅ **Understanding `tsconfig.json`**
- ✅ **Types & Interfaces (Primitives, Custom Types, Union, Intersection)**
- ✅ **Functions with Types**
- ✅ **Type-safe Asynchronous Code (Promises, async/await)**
- ✅ **Object-Oriented TypeScript (Classes, Access Modifiers, Inheritance)**
- ✅ **Modules & Imports**
- ✅ **TypeScript with Express.js**
- ✅ **Environment Variables & Config Management**
- ✅ **Error Handling with Types**
- ✅ **Middleware Typing**

---

### 📦 Why This Matters

By mastering TypeScript on the backend, I’ll be able to:

- Build **robust and scalable APIs** for my Flutter apps
- Use **Edge Functions** with **Supabase** and **Firebase** to offload custom logic securely
- Collaborate and ship **enterprise-level** features with full confidence in type safety

---

### 🔥 Final Goal

To become a **highly capable Full Stack Flutter Developer** with backend superpowers — capable of building secure, scalable, and type-safe server-side applications using modern tools like TypeScript, Supabase, Firebase, MongoDB and Deno.
