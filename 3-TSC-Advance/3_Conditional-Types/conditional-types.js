/*
 Conditional Types in TypeScript:

 1. Conditional Types allow you to create " types " based on a condition
 2. The syntax is similar to ternary operators in JavaScript:

    A extends B ? C : D

 3. This can be read as: " If A can be assigned to B, then the type is C, otherwise D "

 4. This is very useful when working with generics and advanced type transformations
